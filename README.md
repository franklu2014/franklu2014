### Hi there, my name is Frank Lu ðŸ‘‹.

I like Data Science, Machine Learning, Software Engineering and enjoy building end-to-end data services that deliver useful insights.

- Projects for fun:
  - [Domain-specific BERT for QA](https://huggingface.co/franklu/pubmed_bert_squadv2): finetuning a pre-trained BERT for question-answering in medical domain
  - [Rock sample analysis with neural network](https://github.com/franklu2014/core_sample_analysis/blob/main/core_sample.ipynb): clustering of rock sample images using neural network models and K-Means
  - [Movie Database using PostgreSQL](https://github.com/franklu2014/coding_practice/blob/master/local_imdb_setup.ipynb): expanded the learning of PostgreSQL by setting up a local movies database and pgAdmin client.
  - [Vancouver Crime Map](https://github.com/franklu2014/vancouver-crime-stats): an interactive web app on Heroku for geospatial and seasonal visualizations of crime patterns in Vancouver neighbourhoods

- Projects I am working on:
  - [Data Science using Airflow Pipeline](https://github.com/franklu2014/data_science_with_airflow): an attempt to analyze and model the relationship between Tweeter posting and weather signals across Lower Mainland BC
